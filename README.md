This site is built using:

- **React-Bootstrap** — Bootstrap components for React
- **Bootstrap 5** — responsive grid and styling framework
- **GitHub Pages** — hosting and deployment
- **GitHub Actions** — automated CI/CD for builds and deployment
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — application logic
- **HTML5 & CSS3** — base structure and styling
